## ‚ú® Features

- **Discover Popular Movies:** Fetches and displays a grid of the most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
- **Dynamic Search:** A real-time search bar that updates results as the user types. Implemented with a `debounce` mechanism to optimize API calls.
- **Detailed Movie Page:** A dedicated, dynamic route for each movie (`/movie/:id`) that shows detailed information such as overview, rating, release date, and backdrop image.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Utilizes `React Router DOM` for a seamless, single-page application experience without page reloads.
- **Pagination:** Users can navigate through pages of popular movies or search results.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern UI that is functional on various screen sizes.
- **Loading & Error States:** Provides feedback to the user while fetching data or if no results are found.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks:** Used functional components with `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for handling side effects (API calls).
- **Vite:** A modern frontend build tool for a fast development experience.
- **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side routing and navigation.
- **Fetch API:** Used `async/await` for making asynchronous requests to the TMDb API.
- **CSS3:** For custom styling, layout (Grid), and creating a responsive, dark-themed interface.
- **Environment Variables:** To securely store and use the API key.
