A sleek and responsive single-page application built with React.js that allows users to discover popular movies, search for their favorites, and view detailed information. This project was built to practice and demonstrate core React concepts including state management, API data fetching, and client-side routing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Discover Popular Movies:** Fetches and displays a grid of the most popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
- **Dynamic Search:** A real-time search bar that updates results as the user types. Implemented with a `debounce` mechanism to optimize API calls.
- **Detailed Movie Page:** A dedicated, dynamic route for each movie (`/movie/:id`) that shows detailed information such as overview, rating, release date, and backdrop image.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Utilizes `React Router DOM` for a seamless, single-page application experience without page reloads.
- **Pagination:** Users can navigate through pages of popular movies or search results.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern UI that is functional on various screen sizes.
- **Loading & Error States:** Provides feedback to the user while fetching data or if no results are found.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks:** Used functional components with `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for handling side effects (API calls).
- **Vite:** A modern frontend build tool for a fast development experience.
- **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side routing and navigation.
- **Fetch API:** Used `async/await` for making asynchronous requests to the TMDb API.
- **CSS3:** For custom styling, layout (Grid), and creating a responsive, dark-themed interface.
- **Environment Variables:** To securely store and use the API key.
- **Intl.DateTimeFormat:** A built-in JavaScript API for formatting dates in a user-friendly way.
